# History

The party was founded as a direct successor to the former
[Nationalist Party of Waydines](Nationalist_Party_of_Waydines), which operated during the
[Second Republic](Second_Republic_of_Waydines). The transition to the Third Republic, marked by
extensive institutional restructuring, resulted in the transformation of the nationalist movement
into a unified [center-left](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre-left_politics) and
[center-right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre-right_politics) political project, focused on
democratic stability and social justice.

The new party adopted the name _Social Democrats_ to reflect its alignment with the values of the
[Nordic model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_model) and modern
[social democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social-democracy), marking a break from previous
[nationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism).

# Leadership

The party is led by [Cupertino Kurt](Cupertino_Kurt), a central figure in Waydines politics since
its founding. Kurt served as prime minister on two occasions under the previous regime and played a
determining role in the transition to the new parliamentary arrangement. Under his leadership, the
SocDem guided the drafting of the [Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution) of the
Third Republic, as well as important legal frameworks, such as the
[Electoral Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_law) and legislation on
[Devolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devolution), which decentralizes regional competencies.

# Political Profile

The Social Democrats present themselves as a stable and moderate force, attractive to diverse social
segments due to their emphasis on social equity, solid institutional reforms, and governmental
responsibility. Their electoral base tends to include citizens with aspirations for political
stability, social justice, and friendly international relations, primarily with the rest of
[Elysium](Elysium).
