# Government

As Prime Minister, Cupertino led the Constituent Assembly of Waydines, playing a fundamental role in
drafting the new National Constitution, considered the most democratic in the world. His government
has been characterized by the strengthening of civil rights and the creation of various basic laws
for establishing Waydines as an organized and republican country. Although he was a controversial
figure in the past, especially during the period of the
[Second Republic](Second_Republic_of_Waydines), he is currently well-regarded by the people due to
the stability and institutional advances promoted during his administration.

His government has distinguished itself in diplomacy, promoting peace and global cooperation. Thanks
to his unparalleled diplomatic skill, Waydines has become one of the most peaceful countries in the
world. He fostered the formation of international organizations for peace, such as the
[Red Crescent](Red_Crescent) and the [Forum of Nations](Forum_of_Nations); as well as alliances,
treaties, and pacts like the [Elysian Union](Elysian_Union) and the [Solar Pact](Solar_Pact).
